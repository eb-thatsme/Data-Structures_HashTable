# Data-Structures_HashTable
In this Python project, simulated packets of student information is recevied at irregular intervals. Each packet contains information about a single student: name, student ID, gpa, and major. As data arrives, it is stored in a queue until it can be processed. Data is "processed" by popping it out of the queue, and then storing it into a hash table so that it can be easily searched in the future. See .docx file for greater project details
